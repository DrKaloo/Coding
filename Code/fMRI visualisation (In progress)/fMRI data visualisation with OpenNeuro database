# fMRI visualisation project - early stages
# Working with OpenNeuro ds006111 dataset for practice
# Goal: learn to visualise brain data for my MSc preparation

import nibabel as nib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Dataset path (need to update when I download it)
data_direc = "ds006111"
anato_path = ".....nii.gz"

# Basic test to see if libraries work
print("Libraries imported successfully")
print("Ready to start working with brain data")

# Next steps:
# - Download ds006111 dataset from OpenNeuro
# - Figure out how to load .nii.gz files with nibabel
# - Try plotting some brain slices
# - Look into different viewing orientations (axial, sagittal, coronal)
# - Eventually work with functional data too

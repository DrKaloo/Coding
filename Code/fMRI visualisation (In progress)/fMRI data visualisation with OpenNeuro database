# fMRI Data Visualisation (OpenNeuro – ds006111) Big scope project to integrate all fields into a big project

# Project Status: In Progress – Early Stages

This is an exploratory project focused on visualising functional MRI (fMRI) data using publicly available BIDS-format datasets from the OpenNeuro repository.

I am currently working with dataset [`ds006111`](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds006111/versions/1.0.0), which provides a minimal example of fMRI and anatomical data. While this dataset is small and synthetic, it serves as a valuable starting point for understanding how to:

- Navigate and interpret BIDS-compliant fMRI datasets
- Load `.nii.gz` files using Python libraries such as `nibabel` and `nilearn`
- Visualise brain volume slices (axial, coronal, sagittal) 
- Lay the foundation for future preprocessing and statistical pipelines

# Current Work Focus

- [ ] Successfully load and inspect NIfTI files (anatomical + functional)
- [ ] Visualise anatomical volume slices using `matplotlib`
- [ ] Apply brain masking and noise filtering
- [ ] Visualise functional activity over time
- [ ] Prepare preprocessing workflow using `nilearn`

# Long-Term Goals

- Transition from simple static visualisation to dynamic brain activity maps
- Use more complex OpenNeuro datasets (e.g. task-based or resting-state fMRI)
- Connect with cognitive tasks and metadata
- Explore dimensionality reduction, region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, or eventually topological data analysis


# This project has a big scope as many of the areas are not yet clear to my knowledge and understanding. 

# Doing this will allow me to prepare for my postgraduate studies in Computational Neuroscience and sharpen my skills in coding!

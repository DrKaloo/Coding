Hi, I'm Kaloyan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Psychology BSc (Hons) graduate with a passion for bridging neuroscience, biology, and technology through code.

I'm currently preparing for postgraduate study in Computational Neuroscience, and I'm focused on building real-world projects that connect biological data with machine learning.

My recent work includes:
- Simulations of neural behaviour (e.g., Hodgkin-Huxley models)
- Exploratory data analysis in psychology and cognitive science
- A home-built microscopy-AI pipeline for biological image classification

I'm learning Python through hands-on projects and courses from Udemy and Harvard Online. I also work with tools like:
- `NumPy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `OpenCV`
- `JASP` and Excel for data analysis
- Jupyter Notebooks & Git for version control
  Though on these ones I still require a lot more practice!

ðŸŒ± 
Always learning, always experimenting. I use GitHub to track my development and share my growth as I move toward a career in computational neuroscience, diagnostics, and neurotechnology.

Feel free to explore my repositories, or connect with me if you're working on similar interdisciplinary projects!
